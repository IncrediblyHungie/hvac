        <div class="service-detail">
          <p class="service-detail-text">Downtown San Diego is a different kind of neighborhood. Condo towers rise above the Gaslamp Quarter, East Village lofts overlook Petco Park, and Little Italy's bustling restaurants spill out onto sidewalks year-round. A-Tech Repair brings specialized HVAC and appliance expertise to this dense urban core, where the repair challenges are as vertical as the skyline. Whether you live on the 30th floor of a Marina District high-rise or run a restaurant on India Street, we understand the systems that keep downtown comfortable and operational.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">High-rise living dominates downtown San Diego, and the HVAC systems in these buildings are fundamentally different from those in suburban homes. Many downtown condo towers use water-source heat pumps, fan coil units, or packaged terminal air conditioners -- systems that require technicians with specific training and experience. When your unit's PTAC stops heating on a cool January evening or the fan coil in your Cortez Hill condo starts leaking, you need a repair company that has worked in these buildings before. Our technicians are experienced with the major downtown residential towers and understand how individual unit systems interact with building-wide infrastructure like chilled water loops and central boilers.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Downtown's commercial HVAC demands are equally significant. The Gaslamp Quarter alone contains hundreds of restaurants, bars, and retail spaces -- all packed into historic buildings that were never designed for the cooling loads they now carry. Many Gaslamp businesses rely on rooftop units perched above 19th-century facades, and accessing these systems requires technicians who are comfortable working in tight, elevated spaces. East Village's newer mixed-use buildings have more modern systems but still need regular maintenance to handle the heat that radiates off surrounding concrete and glass. We service it all, from the smallest cafe on Fifth Avenue to full-floor commercial spaces in the Columbia District.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Appliance repair in downtown condos comes with its own set of considerations. Many units feature high-end, European-sized appliances -- compact dishwashers, ventless dryers, and counter-depth refrigerators that not every repair company is equipped to service. The built-in wine coolers, induction cooktops, and steam ovens found in luxury towers like the Pacific Gate or Pinnacle require technicians who have worked with premium brands and understand the electronics involved. We also handle the more standard appliance repairs that every downtown resident needs -- fixing the washer that floods the laundry closet, the dishwasher that will not drain, or the refrigerator that is running warm. For property managers and HOAs, we provide reliable, professional service that meets the expectations of downtown residents.</p>
