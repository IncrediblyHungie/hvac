          <p class="service-detail-text">Point Loma is a neighborhood shaped by the ocean. From the sweeping views at Cabrillo National Monument to the fishing boats docked along Shelter Island, life on this peninsula has always been connected to the sea. A-Tech Repair serves Point Loma homeowners and businesses with HVAC and appliance repair built around the unique challenges of coastal living. The salt-laden air that makes Point Loma so beautiful is also one of the toughest enemies your air conditioning condenser and outdoor equipment will ever face.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The ocean air in Point Loma accelerates corrosion on outdoor HVAC components at a rate that residents further inland rarely experience. Condenser coils, copper refrigerant lines, and metal housings on exterior AC units degrade faster when constantly exposed to salt spray and marine moisture. We see this regularly in the homes along Sunset Cliffs Boulevard, the hillside properties overlooking the harbor, and the residences near the Point Loma Seafoods area. Our technicians know which protective coatings and corrosion-resistant components to recommend, and we perform the kind of preventive maintenance that extends the life of your equipment in this demanding coastal environment.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Point Loma's housing ranges from stately Spanish Colonial Revival homes on Chatsworth Boulevard to mid-century ranch houses in the Loma Portal area, military family housing near the Naval bases, and the newer mixed-use developments at Liberty Station. Each style brings different HVAC considerations. The older Spanish-style homes often have thick stucco walls and small windows that help with natural cooling but make ductwork installation complex. Military housing tends to have standardized systems that need consistent maintenance. The Liberty Station lofts and condos feature modern HVAC but require technicians who understand multi-unit systems. We handle all of it.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Point Loma's proximity to the ocean means many homes rely heavily on natural ventilation and use their HVAC systems less frequently than inland neighborhoods -- but when they do need cooling or heating, those systems must work reliably. We often find that Point Loma HVAC units have sat idle for months, accumulating salt deposits and moisture that lead to problems when the system is finally switched on during an unseasonably warm stretch. Regular seasonal maintenance is especially important here, and we offer service plans tailored to Point Loma's unique coastal conditions. We also service the commercial kitchens and cold storage at the many seafood restaurants and fish markets along Rosecrans Street and Shelter Island Drive.</p>
