          <p class="service-detail-text">A broken washer or dryer disrupts your entire week. Suddenly you're hauling laundry bags to the laundromat, wearing wrinkled clothes, or running out of clean towels. The good news is that many washer and dryer problems have straightforward causes, and some you can fix yourself without calling a technician.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Here are the most common problems we see at A-Tech Repair, organized by appliance, with clear guidance on what's a DIY fix and what needs professional help.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Washer Problems</h3>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Washer Won't Drain</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">You open the washer and find your clothes sitting in a pool of standing water. This is one of the most common washing machine complaints, and the most frequent cause is surprisingly simple: a clogged drain pump filter.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Most front-load washers and many newer top-loaders have an accessible drain pump filter, usually behind a small panel at the front bottom of the machine. This filter catches coins, buttons, hair ties, paper clips, and other small items before they reach the drain pump. When it gets clogged, water can't drain.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Other causes include a kinked or clogged drain hose, a failed drain pump motor, or a lid switch that's not engaging (on top-loaders, the machine won't drain if it thinks the lid is open).</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>DIY fix:</strong> Locate the drain pump filter, place towels and a shallow pan underneath, and open it slowly. Water will pour out, so be ready. Remove any debris from the filter, rinse it, and replace it. Also check that the drain hose behind the machine isn't kinked or clogged. If the filter is clean and the hose is clear, the drain pump motor may have failed and needs professional replacement.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Washer Shakes or Vibrates Excessively</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Some vibration during the spin cycle is normal, but if your washer is walking across the laundry room or banging loudly enough to hear from another floor, something is off.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The most common cause is an unbalanced load. A single heavy item like a comforter or bath mat spinning alone creates a lopsided weight distribution that throws the drum off balance. Overloading also causes excessive vibration because the drum can't spin freely.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">If the machine vibrates regardless of load size, check that it's level. All four feet should be firmly on the floor with no rocking. Many washers have adjustable leveling feet that you can turn by hand. On front-load washers, also check that the shipping bolts have been removed. These are large bolts in the back of the machine that lock the drum during transport. We've seen machines that have been running for months with shipping bolts still installed.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>DIY fix:</strong> Redistribute the load, ensure the machine is level, and check for shipping bolts. If the problem persists with balanced loads on a level machine, the shock absorbers or suspension springs may be worn. That's a professional repair.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Washer Won't Start</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">You press the start button and nothing happens. No sounds, no lights, no response. Or the control panel lights up but the machine won't begin a cycle.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Start with the basics: make sure the machine is plugged in and the outlet has power (test with another device). Check that the door or lid is fully closed and latched. Modern washers have a door lock mechanism that must engage before the cycle starts. If the door lock is broken, the machine won't run even though the door appears closed.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Other causes include a tripped circuit breaker, a failed control board, a bad timer, or a faulty water inlet valve (the machine won't start if it can't fill with water).</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>DIY fix:</strong> Check the power outlet, reset the circuit breaker, make sure the door is firmly closed, and try a different cycle. Some washers have a reset procedure where you unplug the machine for one minute, then hold the start button for 5 seconds after plugging it back in. If none of that works, it's time for a technician.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Dryer Problems</h3>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Dryer Runs But Doesn't Heat</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The drum is spinning, your clothes are tumbling, but after a full cycle everything is still damp. This is the single most common dryer repair call we receive, and the leading cause is restricted airflow from a clogged lint system.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Your dryer's lint trap catches most lint, but not all of it. Over time, lint accumulates in the vent duct that runs from the dryer to the outside of your house. This restricts airflow, which causes the dryer to overheat internally. When the internal temperature gets too high, the thermal fuse blows. The thermal fuse is a one-time safety device. Once it blows, the heating element is disabled until the fuse is replaced.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">In San Diego, many homes have long dryer vent runs that go through walls, up to the roof, or across the attic. The longer the run, the more likely lint buildup becomes. The International Residential Code recommends a maximum vent length of 35 feet (with deductions for each elbow), and many San Diego homes exceed this.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>DIY fix:</strong> Clean the lint trap thoroughly. Disconnect the vent duct from the back of the dryer and clean it out with a dryer vent brush or leaf blower. Check the outside vent flap to make sure it opens freely and isn't blocked by debris or a bird's nest. If you've cleaned everything and the dryer still doesn't heat, the thermal fuse, heating element, or gas ignitor likely needs replacement. These are professional repairs.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Safety note:</strong> Lint buildup is a fire hazard. The U.S. Fire Administration reports that dryers cause an estimated 2,900 home fires per year, and failure to clean the vent is the leading cause. Clean your dryer vent at least once a year.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Dryer Makes Loud Noises</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">A dryer that squeaks, thumps, grinds, or rumbles is telling you something is wearing out. The specific noise points to the specific part.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Squealing or squeaking:</strong> Usually the drum belt or drum bearing. The belt wraps around the drum and over a motor pulley. When it gets worn or frayed, it slips and squeals. The idler pulley that keeps tension on the belt can also develop a squeak when its bearing wears out.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Thumping:</strong> Often caused by drum rollers that have flat spots from wear. The drum rides on these rollers, and when they develop flat spots, you hear a rhythmic thumping with each rotation. Can also be something stuck in the drum baffle or between the drum and the housing.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Grinding or scraping:</strong> This typically means the drum glides (felt pads or plastic slides that the drum rides on) are worn down to metal. The drum is now scraping against the housing. Running the dryer in this condition can damage the drum itself.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>DIY fix:</strong> Check for foreign objects in the drum or caught between the drum and the door seal. If the noise is mechanical (belt, rollers, glides), these parts are wear items that need replacement. While some handy homeowners tackle these repairs, they require partially disassembling the dryer. For most people, this is a job for a repair technician.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Dryer Takes Multiple Cycles to Dry</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">If your dryer heats but clothes still come out damp after a normal cycle, the issue is almost always airflow. This is a milder version of the "dryer doesn't heat" problem. The vent is partially restricted, so the dryer produces heat but can't exhaust moisture-laden air efficiently.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Besides the lint buildup described above, check that the vent duct material is correct. Flexible vinyl or foil ducts crush easily and trap lint in their ridges. Rigid or semi-rigid metal duct is the recommended material. Also ensure the vent run isn't longer than code allows for your configuration.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>DIY fix:</strong> Clean the entire vent system from dryer to exterior vent cap. If you have flexible plastic or foil vent duct, replace it with rigid or semi-rigid metal. Make sure the duct connections are secure and sealed with foil tape (never screws, which catch lint). If the vent is clean, the right material, and the right length, then the issue may be a weak heating element, a failing moisture sensor, or a blower wheel problem.</p>
