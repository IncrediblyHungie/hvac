      <div class="container">
        <div class="service-detail">
          <p class="service-detail-text">San Diego's climate is one of the best in the country. Mild winters, warm summers, and very little rain. That pleasant weather can create a false sense of security when it comes to HVAC maintenance. Many homeowners assume that because they don't blast their heating all winter or run the AC around the clock in summer, their system doesn't need regular service.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The reality is that San Diego has its own set of environmental factors that wear on HVAC systems in ways you might not expect. Understanding these factors, and following a maintenance schedule that accounts for them, can extend the life of your system by years and prevent costly emergency repairs.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">The Recommended Schedule: Twice a Year</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The HVAC industry standard is two professional maintenance visits per year. The ideal timing is:</p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>Spring (March or April):</strong> Service your air conditioning system before summer heat arrives. This ensures your AC is clean, fully charged with refrigerant, and ready for the heavy-use months ahead.</li>
            <li><strong>Fall (October or November):</strong> Service your heating system before the cooler months. Even though San Diego winters are mild, nighttime temperatures in inland areas like Rancho Bernardo and Rancho Penasquitos can drop into the low 40s, and you want reliable heat when you need it.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="service-detail-text">This twice-yearly schedule isn't just about preventing breakdowns. Regular maintenance keeps your system running at peak efficiency, which directly affects your energy bills. The Department of Energy estimates that neglected HVAC systems lose 5% of their efficiency each year they go without maintenance. Over five years of skipping tune-ups, that's a 25% increase in energy consumption for the same amount of cooling.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">San Diego-Specific Factors That Affect Your System</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">San Diego's climate is unique, and your maintenance schedule should account for local conditions that many generic HVAC guides don't address.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Coastal salt air.</strong> If you live within a few miles of the ocean, including neighborhoods like La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Clairemont, or Miramar, salt-laden air is constantly working on your outdoor condenser unit. Salt accelerates corrosion on the aluminum fins, copper tubing, and electrical connections. Over time, this corrosion reduces the condenser's ability to release heat and can cause refrigerant leaks. Coastal homeowners should have their condenser coils rinsed and inspected more frequently. Some technicians recommend a mid-summer condenser rinse in addition to the standard spring and fall visits.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Santa Ana winds.</strong> These hot, dry winds typically blow from the inland deserts through San Diego County several times a year, usually between October and March. Santa Ana events carry enormous amounts of fine dust, sand, and debris. This material gets pulled into your outdoor condenser unit and can clog the coils in a single bad wind event. It also infiltrates your home and rapidly clogs air filters. After a significant Santa Ana wind event, check your air filter even if you recently replaced it. You may be surprised at how dirty it is.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Year-round AC usage.</strong> Unlike cities with harsh winters where AC systems sit idle for four to five months, many San Diego homes use their air conditioning eight to ten months of the year. Inland communities regularly see temperatures in the 80s and 90s from May through October, and even November and April can bring warm days. This extended usage means more wear on compressors, fan motors, and capacitors compared to systems in seasonal climates.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Pollen and outdoor allergens.</strong> San Diego's plant diversity means something is always in bloom. Year-round pollen loads affect not just allergy sufferers but also HVAC filters. If anyone in your household has allergies or respiratory issues, consider upgrading to a MERV 11 or MERV 13 filter and changing it every 30 to 45 days.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">What a Professional Tune-Up Includes</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">A thorough HVAC tune-up is more than a quick visual check. Here's what a qualified technician should cover during a maintenance visit:</p>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>Inspect and clean condenser coils:</strong> Dirty coils force the compressor to work harder, increasing energy consumption and accelerating wear.</li>
            <li><strong>Check refrigerant levels:</strong> Low refrigerant indicates a leak that needs repair. Running on low refrigerant damages the compressor.</li>
            <li><strong>Test electrical connections:</strong> Loose or corroded connections can cause intermittent failures, component damage, or safety hazards.</li>
            <li><strong>Inspect and test capacitors:</strong> Capacitors provide the electrical boost that starts the compressor and fan motors. A failing capacitor is one of the most common causes of AC breakdowns.</li>
            <li><strong>Lubricate moving parts:</strong> Fan motor bearings and other moving components need periodic lubrication to reduce friction and prevent premature failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Clean the condensate drain:</strong> A clogged drain line can cause water damage inside your home and create conditions for mold growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Check thermostat calibration:</strong> Even a two-degree discrepancy between your thermostat reading and the actual room temperature can affect comfort and efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Inspect the blower motor and fan belt:</strong> A worn belt or struggling motor reduces airflow throughout your home.</li>
            <li><strong>Check ductwork:</strong> Leaky ducts can waste 20% to 30% of the air your system produces, according to Energy Star estimates.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Signs You're Overdue for Maintenance</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">If you can't remember the last time a technician looked at your system, watch for these warning signs that indicate your HVAC needs attention sooner rather than later:</p>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>Rising energy bills:</strong> If your electricity costs are climbing but your usage habits haven't changed, your system is likely losing efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Uneven temperatures:</strong> Some rooms are too hot while others are comfortable. This can indicate dirty coils, low refrigerant, ductwork problems, or a failing blower motor.</li>
            <li><strong>Strange noises:</strong> Grinding, squealing, rattling, or buzzing sounds that weren't there before usually indicate a mechanical problem that will get worse without attention.</li>
            <li><strong>Musty or burning smells:</strong> A musty smell suggests mold in the ductwork or on the evaporator coil. A burning smell could indicate an electrical problem and should be addressed immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Longer run times:</strong> If your system runs for 20 to 30 minutes or longer to reach the set temperature when it used to take 10 to 15 minutes, something is reducing its capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>Visible dust from vents:</strong> Dust blowing from your vents when the system kicks on means your filter is saturated or your ducts are dirty.</li>
            <li><strong>Short cycling:</strong> The system turns on, runs for a few minutes, shuts off, and then restarts shortly after. This puts enormous stress on the compressor and drastically increases energy consumption.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">DIY Maintenance Between Professional Visits</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Between your twice-yearly professional tune-ups, there are several things you can do yourself to keep your system running well:</p>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>Change your air filter every one to three months depending on filter type and household conditions (pets, allergies, proximity to coast).</li>
            <li>Keep the area around your outdoor condenser unit clear. Trim plants and remove debris so there's at least two feet of clearance on all sides.</li>
            <li>Gently rinse your outdoor condenser coils with a garden hose every few months. Spray from the inside out to push debris away from the coils. Do not use a pressure washer.</li>
            <li>Check that your condensate drain line is clear. You can pour a cup of white vinegar down the drain access point every few months to prevent algae buildup.</li>
            <li>Make sure all supply and return vents inside your home are open and unobstructed by furniture, rugs, or curtains.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">The Cost of Maintenance vs. the Cost of Neglect</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">A professional HVAC tune-up in San Diego typically costs between $75 and $150 per visit. Two visits per year puts your annual maintenance cost at $150 to $300. Compare that to common emergency repair costs: a capacitor replacement runs $200 to $400, a refrigerant leak repair costs $300 to $1,500, and a compressor replacement can set you back $1,500 to $3,000.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Regular maintenance also protects your manufacturer warranty. Most HVAC manufacturers require proof of annual professional maintenance to honor warranty claims. If your compressor fails at year six of a ten-year warranty and you can't show maintenance records, the manufacturer can deny the claim.</p>
