        <div class="service-detail">
          <p class="service-detail-text">Your refrigerator runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It's the hardest-working appliance in your home, and most people don't think about it until something goes wrong. But a failing refrigerator doesn't just stop working overnight. It sends warning signs for days or weeks before a full breakdown, and catching those signals early can save you from spoiled food, water damage, and a much larger repair bill.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Here are the five most common signs that your refrigerator needs professional attention.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">1. Food Is Spoiling Faster Than It Should</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">If your milk is going bad before the expiration date, your lettuce is wilting within a day or two, or your leftovers smell off sooner than expected, your refrigerator likely isn't maintaining the correct temperature. A healthy fridge keeps the main compartment between 35 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit. Even a few degrees warmer creates an environment where bacteria multiply rapidly.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The cause could be a failing thermostat that's not reading temperature accurately, a worn door gasket letting warm air seep in, a malfunctioning defrost system, or a compressor that's losing its ability to cool. San Diego's warm climate makes this worse because ambient temperatures around your fridge are higher, forcing it to work harder to maintain internal temps.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Put a thermometer in a glass of water in the middle of your fridge and check it after 24 hours. If it reads above 40 degrees, something is wrong. Before calling a technician, check that the temperature dial hasn't been accidentally bumped and that the vents inside the fridge aren't blocked by food items pushed up against them.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">2. The Motor Runs Constantly</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Your refrigerator's compressor cycles on and off throughout the day. You'll hear a low hum when it's running and silence when it cycles off. This is normal. What's not normal is a compressor that runs continuously without stopping or one that cycles on and off every few minutes.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">A constantly running motor usually means the fridge is struggling to reach or maintain the target temperature. The most common causes are dirty condenser coils (the coils on the back or bottom of the unit that release heat), a failing compressor, low refrigerant, or a faulty condenser fan. When condenser coils are caked with dust and pet hair, they can't release heat efficiently, so the compressor has to run longer and harder.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Beyond the annoyance of a motor that never stops humming, this constant operation drives up your electricity bill. A fridge that runs nonstop can use 30 to 50 percent more energy than one cycling normally.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Unplug the fridge, pull it away from the wall, and look at the condenser coils. If they're coated in dust or debris, clean them with a coil brush or vacuum attachment. This alone fixes the problem in many cases. If the coils are clean and the motor still runs constantly, the issue is internal and needs a technician.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">3. Unusual Noises</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Refrigerators make sounds. A gentle hum from the compressor, a soft whoosh of air circulating, occasional clicks as the defrost timer switches, and the gurgle of refrigerant flowing through the lines are all normal. But new, loud, or persistent sounds are warning signs.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Clicking or buzzing from the back:</strong> Often points to a failing compressor relay or start capacitor. The compressor is trying to start but can't, so it clicks and tries again repeatedly. Left unaddressed, this burns out the compressor itself, turning a $150 relay replacement into a $500+ compressor job.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Grinding or scraping:</strong> Usually indicates a fan motor problem. Your fridge has two fans, the evaporator fan inside the freezer compartment and the condenser fan near the compressor. When bearings wear out, these fans make grinding noises. A failing evaporator fan also means cold air isn't circulating properly.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Loud humming or vibrating:</strong> Can mean the compressor is working too hard or the fridge isn't level. Check that the unit is sitting flat on the floor. If it rocks, adjust the leveling legs. If it's level and still loud, the compressor may be failing.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Try to identify where the noise is coming from. If it's from the back/bottom, it's likely compressor or condenser-fan related. If it's from inside the freezer, it's probably the evaporator fan. Either way, unusual noises are best diagnosed by a technician before a minor issue becomes a major one.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">4. Water Pooling Under or Inside the Fridge</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Finding a puddle of water under your refrigerator or pools of water inside the compartment is never a good sign. Beyond the inconvenience, standing water can damage your flooring, promote mold growth, and create a slip hazard.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The most common cause is a clogged defrost drain. During the automatic defrost cycle, ice on the evaporator coils melts and drains into a pan beneath the fridge where it evaporates. If the drain line gets clogged with food particles or ice, the water backs up and pools inside the freezer or leaks onto the floor.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Other causes include a cracked or overflowing drain pan, a leaking water inlet valve (if your fridge has a water dispenser or ice maker), or a damaged door gasket that lets humid air in, causing excessive condensation.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Check the drain pan under the fridge first. If it's cracked, it needs replacement. For a clogged defrost drain, you can sometimes clear it by flushing warm water through the drain hole inside the freezer using a turkey baster. If water is coming from the water line connections, tighten the fittings or replace the supply line. Persistent leaks need professional diagnosis.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">5. Excessive Frost Buildup in the Freezer</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Modern frost-free freezers use an automatic defrost system that periodically melts any ice buildup on the evaporator coils. If you're seeing thick frost coating the walls of your freezer, ice accumulating on food packages, or a freezer that looks like the inside of an igloo, the defrost system has failed.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The defrost system has three main components: a defrost timer (or control board) that tells the system when to defrost, a defrost heater that melts the ice, and a defrost thermostat that monitors temperature. Any of these can fail. The result is the same: ice builds up on the evaporator coils, blocks airflow, and eventually your freezer and fridge both stop cooling properly.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> As a temporary fix, unplug the fridge and leave the doors open for 24 hours to let everything thaw completely. Place towels on the floor to catch the water. After it's fully defrosted, plug it back in. If the frost returns within a week or two, the defrost system needs repair. Don't keep manually defrosting; the underlying problem will only get worse.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">When to Repair vs. When to Replace</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Most refrigerators last 10 to 15 years. If yours is under 8 years old and the repair costs less than half the price of a comparable new model, repairing is almost always the right call. For older fridges facing major repairs like a compressor replacement, a new Energy Star-rated model will often pay for itself through lower electricity bills within a few years.</p>
