      <div class="container">
        <div class="service-detail">
          <p class="service-detail-text">You walk into your San Diego home expecting cool relief, but the air coming from your vents feels lukewarm or even warm. It's one of the most common HVAC complaints we hear, especially during the summer months when temperatures in inland neighborhoods like Rancho Bernardo and Mira Mesa regularly push past 90 degrees.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The good news is that warm air from your AC usually points to one of five identifiable problems. Some of these you can troubleshoot yourself in minutes. Others require a trained technician. Here's what to check, in order from simplest to most complex.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">1. Dirty or Clogged Air Filter</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">This is the single most common reason an AC stops cooling properly, and it's the easiest to fix. Your air filter catches dust, pollen, pet dander, and other particles before they reach the evaporator coil. When the filter gets clogged, it chokes off airflow. Without enough air moving across the evaporator coil, the coil can't absorb heat effectively, and the air leaving your vents won't feel cold.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">San Diego's coastal humidity adds an extra layer to this problem. Moisture in the air causes dust to clump on the filter more quickly than in dry climates, meaning filters clog faster than you might expect. If you live near the coast in areas like La Jolla or Clairemont, you may need to change your filter every 30 to 60 days during heavy-use months rather than the standard 90 days.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Turn off your AC, locate the filter (usually in the return air duct or the air handler unit), and pull it out. If you can't see light through it, replace it. Standard 1-inch filters cost $5 to $15 at any hardware store. After installing a fresh filter, give the system 15 to 20 minutes to start cooling normally.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">2. Refrigerant Leak</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Refrigerant is the chemical compound that actually absorbs heat from your indoor air and releases it outside. Your AC doesn't consume refrigerant like a car burns gas. It circulates the same charge indefinitely in a sealed system. If your refrigerant level is low, it means there's a leak somewhere in the copper lines, coils, or fittings.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">A refrigerant leak usually develops gradually. You may notice your AC struggling to reach the set temperature, running for longer cycles, or producing air that feels cool but not cold. Over time, the system loses enough refrigerant that the air turns noticeably warm. You might also see ice forming on the refrigerant lines near the outdoor unit, which seems counterintuitive but happens because low refrigerant causes the evaporator coil temperature to drop below freezing.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">San Diego's salt air can be particularly hard on outdoor AC components. The salt accelerates corrosion on copper refrigerant lines and aluminum condenser coils, making leaks more common in coastal homes than in inland areas.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> This is not a DIY repair. Refrigerant handling requires EPA certification, and simply "topping off" the system without finding and fixing the leak means the problem will return. A qualified technician will use electronic leak detectors or UV dye to locate the leak, repair it, and recharge the system to the manufacturer's specifications. <a href="../ac-repair.html">Contact A-Tech Repair</a> for a professional diagnosis.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">3. Thermostat Issues</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Sometimes the problem isn't with your AC at all; it's with the device telling it what to do. A malfunctioning thermostat can send incorrect signals to your system, and the result often looks like an AC blowing warm air.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Start with the obvious: make sure your thermostat is set to "cool" (not "heat" or "off") and that the fan setting is on "auto" rather than "on." When the fan is set to "on," it runs continuously even when the compressor isn't actively cooling, which means you'll feel room-temperature air from the vents between cooling cycles. This is normal behavior, not a malfunction, but it's one of the most frequent causes of "my AC is blowing warm air" calls we receive.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">If your thermostat runs on batteries, try replacing them. A low battery can cause erratic behavior, including losing your programmed settings or failing to trigger the compressor. For programmable or smart thermostats, check that the schedule hasn't been accidentally changed.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Verify the settings, replace batteries if applicable, and try lowering the set temperature five degrees below the current room temperature. If the compressor kicks on and cool air starts flowing within a few minutes, the thermostat was likely the issue. If not, you may need a thermostat replacement or the problem lies elsewhere.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">4. Faulty Compressor</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The compressor is the heart of your AC system. It sits in the outdoor unit and pressurizes the refrigerant, which is what allows the entire cooling cycle to work. When the compressor fails, your system literally cannot cool air. The indoor fan will still blow and the outdoor fan may still spin, but no cooling happens.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Compressor failure can be sudden (a loud clunk and then nothing) or gradual (the unit struggles, makes unusual noises, trips the breaker repeatedly, or produces less and less cooling over weeks). Common causes include electrical problems, overheating from dirty condenser coils, running on low refrigerant for extended periods, or simply age-related wear.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>Signs of compressor trouble:</strong></p>
          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>Outdoor unit vibrates heavily or makes grinding, clicking, or buzzing sounds</li>
            <li>Circuit breaker for the AC trips repeatedly</li>
            <li>Outdoor unit runs but the air inside never gets cold</li>
            <li>The system short-cycles, turning on and off every few minutes</li>
            <li>Higher than normal electricity bills without increased usage</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Compressor repair or replacement is a job for a licensed HVAC professional. A new compressor can cost $1,500 to $3,000 installed, so if your system is older than 12 to 15 years, your technician may recommend replacing the entire outdoor unit or the full system instead. This is often the more cost-effective choice in the long run.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">5. Frozen Evaporator Coil</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The evaporator coil sits inside your air handler and is where the actual cooling happens. Refrigerant flowing through the coil absorbs heat from the air being blown over it. When something goes wrong, ice can build up on the coil. A frozen evaporator coil blocks airflow entirely and your system blows warm or room-temperature air.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Several things cause a frozen coil, and most of them are related to the other issues on this list: a clogged air filter (restricts airflow), low refrigerant (drops coil temperature too low), a failing blower motor (reduces air movement), or dirty coils (insulates the coil from the air). San Diego's coastal humidity makes this problem slightly more common here because there's more moisture in the air to freeze on a struggling coil.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> If you suspect a frozen coil, turn off the AC but leave the fan running on "on" mode. This circulates warm air over the coil and helps it thaw. The process typically takes two to four hours depending on how much ice has accumulated. Do not try to chip or scrape ice off the coil, as you can easily damage the delicate aluminum fins. Once it's fully thawed, check your air filter and replace it if needed. If the coil freezes again after thawing, there's an underlying problem that needs professional attention.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">When to Call a Professional</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">If you've checked your filter, verified your thermostat settings, and ensured nothing is blocking your outdoor unit, it's time to call a technician. Problems like refrigerant leaks, compressor failure, and electrical issues require specialized equipment and training to diagnose and repair safely.</p>
