Higher SEER ratings provide greater energy savings but cost more upfront, so there's a point of diminishing returns depending on your usage patterns."

          <p class="service-detail-text">Your AC technician just told you the compressor is failing. The repair estimate is $2,200. Your system is 14 years old. Do you spend the money to fix it, or is this the moment you invest in a new system?</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">This is one of the most stressful decisions a homeowner faces, especially in San Diego where air conditioning isn't optional for much of the year. The wrong choice can mean throwing good money after bad on a dying system, or spending thousands on a new unit when a reasonable repair would have bought you several more years. Here's a framework that HVAC professionals use to make this decision, adapted for San Diego homeowners.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">The 5,000 Rule</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The most widely used guideline in the HVAC industry is the 5,000 rule. It works like this: multiply the age of your system in years by the cost of the proposed repair. If the result is more than $5,000, replacement is generally the better financial choice.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Here are a few examples to see how it works in practice:</p>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>8-year-old unit, $400 repair:</strong> 8 x $400 = $3,200. Under $5,000, so the repair makes sense. The system likely has several good years left.</li>
            <li><strong>12-year-old unit, $500 repair:</strong> 12 x $500 = $6,000. Over $5,000. The math starts favoring replacement, especially if the system has had other recent repairs.</li>
            <li><strong>15-year-old unit, $350 repair:</strong> 15 x $350 = $5,250. Right at the boundary. Consider the system's overall condition and repair history before deciding.</li>
            <li><strong>6-year-old unit, $1,200 repair:</strong> 6 x $1,200 = $7,200. Over $5,000, but the system is relatively young. In this case, check if the repair is covered under warranty before committing to replacement.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The 5,000 rule is a starting point, not an absolute answer. It doesn't account for efficiency differences, available rebates, or the specific condition of your system. But it gives you a quick, objective number to anchor your decision.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">How Long Should an AC Last?</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Understanding typical lifespans helps you gauge where your system stands:</p>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>Central air conditioner:</strong> 15 to 20 years with regular maintenance</li>
            <li><strong>Heat pump:</strong> 12 to 15 years (they work harder because they provide both heating and cooling)</li>
            <li><strong>Ductless mini-split:</strong> 15 to 20 years</li>
            <li><strong>Furnace:</strong> 20 to 30 years</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="service-detail-text">These numbers assume regular professional maintenance. Neglected systems can fail significantly earlier. In San Diego specifically, coastal homes tend to see shorter lifespans. The salt air corrodes condenser coils, electrical connections, and copper refrigerant lines faster than in inland environments. A system in La Jolla or Pacific Beach that gets no extra attention for its coastal exposure might need replacement at 12 to 14 years, while the same system in Rancho Bernardo with regular maintenance could last 18 to 20 years.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">The Efficiency Factor</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">If your system was installed before 2006, it almost certainly uses the older R-22 refrigerant (commonly called Freon). R-22 has been phased out under federal regulations, which means the refrigerant itself has become extremely expensive. If your R-22 system develops a leak, recharging it can cost $100 to $150 per pound of refrigerant, and a typical system holds five to ten pounds. This ongoing cost alone can tip the scales toward replacement.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Beyond refrigerant, older systems simply use more electricity. AC efficiency is measured in SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio). Here's how the numbers have changed over time:</p>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>Systems installed before 2006:</strong> Typically 8 to 10 SEER</li>
            <li><strong>Systems installed 2006-2015:</strong> 13 to 14 SEER (the minimum at the time)</li>
            <li><strong>New systems today:</strong> 15 SEER2 minimum in the Southwest, with high-efficiency models reaching 20+ SEER2</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="service-detail-text">What does that mean for your wallet? A homeowner replacing a 10 SEER system with a 16 SEER2 unit can expect roughly a 35% to 40% reduction in cooling energy costs. In San Diego, where cooling accounts for a significant portion of summer electricity bills, that can translate to $400 to $800 in annual savings depending on your home size and usage. Over the 15-to-20-year life of the new system, those savings can offset a large portion of the purchase price.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">When Repair Makes Sense</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Replacement isn't always the answer. Here are situations where repairing your current system is the smarter move:</p>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>The system is less than 10 years old</strong> and has been regularly maintained. A single repair, even a moderately expensive one, is usually worth it on a younger system.</li>
            <li><strong>The repair is minor:</strong> Capacitor replacement ($150 to $350), contactor replacement ($150 to $300), fan motor replacement ($200 to $500). These are common wear items, not signs the system is dying.</li>
            <li><strong>The system uses R-410A refrigerant</strong> (the current standard). You won't face the escalating refrigerant costs that R-22 systems do.</li>
            <li><strong>This is the first major repair.</strong> One significant repair doesn't mean the system is at the end of its life. It's when repairs start stacking up, two or three in the same year, that the pattern signals deeper problems.</li>
            <li><strong>You're planning to sell the home soon.</strong> A new HVAC system adds value, but you rarely recoup the full cost at resale. If you're selling within a year or two, a repair that keeps the system functional may make more financial sense.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">When Replacement Makes Sense</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">On the other hand, certain situations clearly point toward investing in new equipment:</p>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>The system is 15+ years old</strong> and needs a repair costing more than $1,000. The math rarely favors repair at this age.</li>
            <li><strong>You've had multiple repairs in the past two years.</strong> A pattern of breakdowns indicates the system is in decline, and the next failure is likely around the corner.</li>
            <li><strong>The system uses R-22 refrigerant.</strong> With R-22 prices continuing to climb and the product becoming increasingly scarce, any major repair on an R-22 system is hard to justify.</li>
            <li><strong>Your energy bills are noticeably higher than neighbors with similar homes.</strong> An inefficient system costs you money every single month it runs.</li>
            <li><strong>The system can't keep your home comfortable.</strong> If certain rooms are always too hot or the system runs constantly without reaching the set temperature, the unit may be undersized, failing, or both.</li>
            <li><strong>The compressor or evaporator coil needs replacement.</strong> These are the two most expensive components. On a system over 10 years old, replacing either one often costs half or more of what a new system would cost.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">San Diego Rebates and Incentives</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">If you're leaning toward replacement, the financial picture may be better than you think. San Diego homeowners have access to several incentive programs that can significantly reduce the cost of a new high-efficiency system:</p>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li><strong>SDG&E rebates:</strong> San Diego Gas & Electric offers rebates for qualifying high-efficiency HVAC installations. Rebate amounts vary by equipment type and efficiency rating, but typically range from $200 to $1,500 per system.</li>
            <li><strong>Federal tax credits:</strong> The Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements, including heat pumps and high-efficiency air conditioners. Credits can reach up to $2,000 per year for qualifying heat pump installations.</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturer rebates:</strong> Major brands like Carrier, Lennox, Trane, and Daikin frequently run seasonal promotions with mail-in rebates ranging from $200 to $1,000.</li>
            <li><strong>Financing options:</strong> Many HVAC companies offer 0% interest financing for 12 to 60 months on new installations, making the upfront cost more manageable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="service-detail-text">When you combine utility rebates, federal tax credits, and manufacturer promotions, it's not uncommon to reduce the out-of-pocket cost of a new system by $1,500 to $5,000. Your HVAC contractor should be able to help you identify which incentives apply to your specific situation.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">Get an Honest Assessment</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The best thing you can do when facing a repair-or-replace decision is get an honest evaluation from a technician who isn't purely motivated by selling you new equipment. A good HVAC company will tell you when a repair is the right call, even though a replacement would generate more revenue for them.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">At A-Tech Repair, we walk through the numbers with every customer facing this decision. We'll show you the repair cost, the expected remaining lifespan of your current system, what a new system would cost after rebates, and what you'd save in energy costs. Then we let you decide.</p>
