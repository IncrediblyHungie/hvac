        <div class="service-detail">
          <p class="service-detail-text">San Diego may not get Minnesota-cold, but when nighttime temperatures drop into the 40s during winter months, a heater that won't turn on is a real problem. Inland neighborhoods like Poway, Escondido, and Rancho Bernardo can see lows in the mid-30s, and even coastal areas get cold enough that going without heat isn't an option, especially if you have young children or elderly family members.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The tricky part about heater problems in San Diego is that many homeowners don't realize anything is wrong until the first cold snap. The system sat unused for months, and now that you need it, it won't cooperate. Here are the most common reasons and what you can do about each one.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">1. Thermostat Problems</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Start with the simplest explanation. Your thermostat controls when your heater turns on and what temperature it targets. If the thermostat isn't working correctly, your heater won't respond even though the heating system itself is fine.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Make sure the thermostat is set to "heat" mode and not left on "cool" from summer. Set the target temperature at least 5 degrees above the current room temperature. If you have a programmable thermostat, check that the schedule hasn't reverted to a default setting. Battery-powered thermostats can behave erratically when batteries are low, displaying the correct temperature but failing to send the signal to the furnace.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Replace the batteries, switch to heat mode, bump the temperature up 5 degrees, and wait a few minutes. If nothing happens, try switching the fan setting from "auto" to "on." If the fan runs but no heat comes out, the thermostat is communicating with the system and the problem is elsewhere. If nothing happens at all, the thermostat may need replacement or there's a wiring issue.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">2. Dirty Air Filter</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">This is the same culprit that causes AC problems, and it's just as common with heating. A clogged air filter restricts airflow through the system. Without adequate airflow, the heat exchanger overheats, and the furnace's high-limit safety switch shuts the system down to prevent damage or fire. The furnace may start, run for a few minutes, then shut off, or it may not start at all.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">In San Diego, filters can get especially dirty during fall and early winter. Santa Ana winds blow dust and debris through the region in September through November, right before heating season starts. If you didn't change your filter after the Santa Anas, it may be too clogged to allow proper airflow.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Locate your air filter, pull it out, and inspect it. If it's visibly dirty or clogged, replace it with the same size. Standard filters cost $5 to $15 at hardware stores. After installing a fresh filter, reset the system by turning it off at the thermostat, waiting 30 seconds, then turning it back on.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">3. Pilot Light or Ignition Failure</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Gas furnaces need an ignition source to light the burners. Older furnaces use a standing pilot light, a small flame that burns continuously. Newer furnaces use an electronic ignition system, either a hot surface ignitor or an intermittent pilot. When either type fails, the gas valve opens but the burners don't light, so no heat is produced.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">For standing pilot lights, the flame can be blown out by a draft, or the thermocouple (a safety sensor that detects whether the pilot is lit) can wear out. A bad thermocouple shuts off the gas supply as a safety measure because it can't confirm the pilot is lit.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">For electronic ignition systems, the hot surface ignitor is a fragile ceramic element that glows red-hot to light the gas. These have a typical lifespan of 3 to 7 years and are one of the most common furnace repairs. When they crack or burn out, the furnace won't ignite.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> If you have a standing pilot light, check whether it's lit. If it went out, follow the manufacturer's instructions on the furnace to relight it. If it won't stay lit, the thermocouple likely needs replacement. For electronic ignition systems, you can sometimes hear the ignitor click or see it glow through the furnace's inspection window. If there's no glow or click, the ignitor needs replacement. This is a job for a technician since it involves gas connections.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">4. Tripped Safety Switch or Circuit Breaker</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Furnaces have multiple safety mechanisms designed to prevent fires, gas leaks, and carbon monoxide exposure. When any of these detect a problem, they shut the system down. The furnace door switch, for example, cuts power if the access panel is loose or removed. The high-limit switch shuts things down if the heat exchanger gets too hot. The flame sensor stops gas flow if it can't detect a flame after ignition.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Even electric breakers can trip. Gas furnaces still need electricity to run the blower, control board, and ignition system. If the breaker for your furnace has tripped, the system is dead regardless of the thermostat setting.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Check your electrical panel for a tripped breaker labeled "furnace" or "HVAC." Reset it by flipping it fully off, then back on. Make sure the furnace access panel is fully seated and latched. If the breaker trips again immediately, there's an electrical problem that needs professional attention. Don't keep resetting it.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">5. Blower Motor Problems</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">The blower motor pushes heated air through your ductwork and into your rooms. If the motor fails or its capacitor dies, the furnace may fire up and produce heat at the heat exchanger, but that warm air never reaches your vents. You might notice the furnace running but no air coming from the registers, or weak airflow that barely feels warm.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Blower motors can also overheat if they're old, if the bearings are worn, or if they're working against excessive resistance from clogged filters or blocked ducts. An overheated motor may shut off on its internal thermal protection and restart once it cools down, creating an intermittent heating pattern.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> Listen for the blower. If the furnace ignites (you can hear it fire up) but the fan doesn't start within a minute or two, the blower motor or its capacitor may have failed. This is a repair that requires a technician.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">6. Heat Pump Specific Issues</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Many San Diego homes use heat pumps rather than traditional furnaces, since they work efficiently in our mild climate. Heat pumps cool in summer and reverse the process to heat in winter using a component called the reversing valve. When this valve fails or gets stuck, the system stays in cooling mode even when the thermostat calls for heat.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text">Heat pumps also go through a normal defrost cycle during cold weather where the outdoor unit briefly switches to cooling mode to melt ice off the coils. This is normal and lasts a few minutes. But if the defrost cycle happens too frequently or the unit stays in defrost mode, you'll feel cool air from the vents.</p>

          <p class="service-detail-text"><strong>What to do:</strong> If your heat pump seems stuck in cooling mode, check that the thermostat is set to heat. If it is and you're still getting cool air, the reversing valve or defrost control board may need attention. Heat pump electrical and refrigerant work should always be done by a licensed technician.</p>

          <h3 class="service-detail-subtitle">When to Call a Professional</h3>

          <p class="service-detail-text">If you've checked the thermostat, replaced the filter, verified the breakers, and ensured the access panel is secure, it's time for professional help. Heating systems involve gas, electricity, and combustion, a combination that demands trained, licensed technicians. Never attempt to work on gas connections, heat exchangers, or electrical components yourself.</p>
